# Orange-Demo-Codespace
# Learning Python Orange with GitHub Codespaces

Welcome! This GitHub Codespace is designed to provide you with a ready-to-use environment for learning and experimenting with [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/), a powerful and versatile open-source machine learning and data visualisation toolkit.

## What is Orange?

Orange is a component-based data mining software. It includes a range of data visualisation, exploration, preprocessing, and modeling techniques. You can use it as:

1.  A **visual programming environment** where you build data analysis workflows by connecting widgets (the "Orange Canvas").
2.  A **Python library** for scripting more complex data analysis tasks.

This Codespace is primarily set up for using Orange as a Python library, but the core components for its visual tools are also installed.

## About This Codespace

This Codespace comes pre-configured with:

* A specific version of Python (as defined in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`).
* The **Orange3** Python package and its essential dependencies (like PyQt for its tools).
* Useful VS Code extensions for Python development.

This means you can start coding with Orange right away without worrying about installation hassles!

## Getting Started

1.  **Opening the Codespace:**
    * If you're viewing this repository on GitHub, click the green `<> Code` button, go to the "Codespaces" tab, and click "Create codespace on main" (or your current branch).
    * This will open a VS Code interface directly in your browser or in your local VS Code application if you have it connected to GitHub Codespaces.

2.  **Exploring the Environment:**
    * Once the Codespace is loaded, you'll see a familiar VS Code layout.
    * A terminal should be available (if not, go to `Terminal > New Terminal` in the VS Code menu). This is where you can run Python scripts or other commands.
    * The Orange3 library is already installed.

## Your First Orange Demo: Basic Data Loading and Exploration

Let's run a simple Python script to see Orange in action. We'll load a built-in dataset and print some information about it.

1.  **Create a Python File:**
    * In the Explorer panel on the left, right-click on an empty area (or a folder if you've created one) and select "New File...".
    * Name the file `orange_demo.py`.

2.  **Write the Script:**
    * Copy and paste the following Python code into `orange_demo.py`:

    ```python
    import Orange

    # 1. Load a built-in dataset (e.g., the Iris dataset)
    print("Loading the Iris dataset...")
    iris = Orange.data.Table("iris")

    # 2. Display some basic information about the dataset
    print(f"\nDataset Name: {iris.name}")
    print(f"Number of instances (rows): {len(iris)}")
    print(f"Number of features (columns): {len(iris.domain.attributes)}")
    print(f"Target variable: {iris.domain.class_var.name}")
    print(f"Feature names: {[attr.name for attr in iris.domain.attributes]}")

    # 3. Display the first 5 rows of data
    print("\nFirst 5 instances:")
    for i in range(5):
        print(iris[i])

    # 4. Basic data statistics (requires numpy for mean, std if not already part of Orange's direct output)
    # For simplicity, Orange's domain description provides some info.
    # For more detailed stats, you'd typically use other libraries or Orange's statistics widgets.
    print("\nDomain description:")
    print(iris.domain)

    # 5. (Optional) If you want to try a very simple classification
    # Create a Learner (e.g., Logistic Regression)
    learner = Orange.classification.LogisticRegressionLearner()

    # Create a Resampler (e.g., Cross-Validation)
    # Note: For a proper evaluation, you'd usually split into train/test or use cross-validation.
    # Here, we'll just demonstrate training on the full dataset for simplicity.
    print("\nTraining a simple Logistic Regression model...")
    classifier = learner(iris)

    # Make predictions on the same data (just for demonstration)
    predictions = classifier(iris)

    # Evaluate
    eval_results = Orange.evaluation.CrossValidation(iris, [learner], k=5)
    print(f"\nAccuracy from 5-fold Cross-Validation: {Orange.evaluation.scoring.CA(eval_results)[0]:.3f}")

    print("\nDemo complete! You've successfully used Orange to load data and train a model.")
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    * Open a new terminal in VS Code (if you haven't already).
    * Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```bash
        python3 orange_demo.py
        ```

4.  **Observe the Output:**
    * You should see output in the terminal showing information about the Iris dataset and the accuracy of the simple model. This confirms that Orange is installed and working correctly!

## (Recommended) Using Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for interactive data analysis and learning.

1.  **Create a Jupyter Notebook:**
    * In the Explorer, right-click and select "New File...".
    * Name it `orange_notebook_demo.ipynb`.
    * VS Code should automatically recognise it as a Jupyter Notebook and provide the notebook interface. You might be prompted to select a Python kernel; choose the one available in the Codespace.

2.  **Add and Run Code Cells:**
    * You can copy the Python code from the `orange_demo.py` script above and paste it into one or more cells in your notebook.
    * Run each cell by clicking the "play" button next to it or by pressing `Shift+Enter`.

    **Example Cell 1: Load Data**
    ```python
    import Orange

    # Load a built-in dataset (e.g., the Iris dataset)
    print("Loading the Iris dataset...")
    iris = Orange.data.Table("iris")

    print(f"Dataset Name: {iris.name}")
    print(f"Number of instances: {len(iris)}")
    print(f"Number of features: {len(iris.domain.attributes)}")
    ```

    **Example Cell 2: Display Data**
    ```python
    # Display the first 5 rows
    print("First 5 instances:")
    for i in range(5):
        print(iris[i])
    ```
    *(Continue with other parts of the script in new cells)*

## Exploring Further

Now that you have a working Orange environment, here are some things you can try:

* **Explore other datasets:** Orange has many built-in datasets. Try loading `Orange.data.Table("titanic")` or `Orange.data.Table("zoo")`.
* **Try different learners:** Explore other classification or regression algorithms available in `Orange.classification` or `Orange.regression`.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Look into `Orange.preprocess` for techniques like discretisation or imputation.
* **Visualisations (Programmatic):** While the full Orange Canvas GUI is complex to run directly in a standard Codespace for display, some Orange visualisation components can be used to save plots to files, which you can then view.
* **Consult the Official Documentation:**
    * **Orange Python Library:** [https://orange3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://orange3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    * **Orange Main Website:** [https://orangedatamining.com/](https://orangedatamining.com/)

Happy learning and experimenting with Orange!
